# AoC2024-Rust
My solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 puzzles

### Thoughts
The solutions are run all together in the [main](src/main.rs) file,
compiled down to a single optimized executable.
<br>
The answers are obviously specific to the inputs, which is why I made it so that anyone
can build and run the project with their own inputs (although I tested the program only on Linux).

This was my second time participating in the [**Advent of Code**](https://adventofcode.com/2024)
event, and I loved every moment of it.
<br>
Despite not finishing before Christmas again, I was able to solve most of the puzzles completely on my own and within just a couple days. Thanks to some help from **Reddit** [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/), I was even able to keep the cumulative execution time under at 40-50ms, which is truly insane to me (Rust is a great language).

The best part was again learning a lot of new things about Rust and the topics [Eric](https://github.com/topaz) hides in his wonderful puzzles; focusing on optimized parsing and fast solutions was interesting and a lot of fun.
